Applications look like a technical promise of the future. But reminiscending the past is very important to the mankind. Like Elie Wiesel once said:  
"\textit{Without memory, there is no culture. Without memory, there would be no civilization, no society, no future.} - Gefunden auf: https://www.myzitate.de/erinnerungen/Without memory, there is no culture. Without memory, there would be no civilization, no society, no future - Gefunden auf: https://www.myzitate.de/erinnerungen/".

Therefor the Civitas app should help to keep the memory, and store it for upcoming generations. In detail, it is an approach to store historical monument of the roman empire.
